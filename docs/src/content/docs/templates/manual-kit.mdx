title: Manual (AIK)

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This template uses a manual release script and ships with [Astro Integration Kit](https://astro-integration-kit.netlify.app/). Copy it locally by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm dlx giget@latest gh:florian-lefebvre/astro-integration-template/templates/manual-kit my-integration
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed, and you're logged in (`gh auth login`)

## Setup

<Steps>

{/* TODO: update TODOs with numbers */}

1. Search for `TODO:` and update them

2. Update all occurences of `package-name` with your package name

3. Add a `LICENSE` at the root (if you do it through GitHub interface, you'll be able to see all licenses and pick the best one for your project)

4. Pick the right NPM tags, see [official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/publish-to-npm/#categories)

5. Setup your GitHub repository

</Steps>

## Good practises

- Start working on your integration logic
- Write some docs, either in the README or as a standalone docs website (not included in the template)
- Write good JSDoc annotations
- Format and lint with `pnpm lint:fix`

## Releasing

<Steps>

1. Add a changeset and add a meaningful message:

        ```sh
        pnpm changeset
        ```

        You can write several changesets if applicable.

2. Commit and push

        ```sh
        git add .
        git commit -m "chore: changeset"
        git push
        ```

3. Release (accepts a `--otp` flag)

        ```sh
        pnpm release
        ```

</Steps>
