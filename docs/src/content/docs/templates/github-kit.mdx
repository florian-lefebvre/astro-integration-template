This template uses Github Actions and ships with [Astro Integration Kit](https://astro-integration-kit.netlify.app/). Copy it locally by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm dlx giget@latest gh:florian-lefebvre/astro-integration-template/templates/github-kit my-integration
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a GitHub and NPM account.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Search for `TODO:` and update them.

2. Update all occurrences of `package-name` with your package name.

3. Update .changeset/config.json with your organization's repository name (org/repo-name).

4. Add a `LICENSE` at the root (if you do it through GitHub interface, you'll be able to see all licenses and pick the best one for your project).

5. Pick the right NPM tags, see [official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/publish-to-npm/#categories).

6. Setup your GitHub repository.

7. [Generate](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens) a **classic automation** NPM token (`NPM_TOKEN`).

8. [Generate](https://github.com/settings/tokens) a **classic** GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope (`COMMIT_TOKEN`)

9. Store those secrets on GitHub:

        <Steps>

        1. Go to your GitHub repository.

        2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.

        3. Click **New repository secret** and add `NPM_TOKEN`.

        4. Click **New repository secret** and add `COMMIT_TOKEN`.

        </Steps>

</Steps>

## Good practises

- Start working on your integration logic.
- Write some docs, either in the README or as a standalone docs website (not included in the template).
- Write good JSDoc annotations.
- Format and lint with `pnpm lint:fix`.

## Releasing

This template uses the GitHub Action for Changesets to automatically open a Pull Request to release a package. Once this Pull Request is merged, the package will be published to NPM.

<Steps>

1. Add a changeset and add a meaningful message:

        ```sh
        pnpm changeset
        ```

        You can write several changesets if applicable.

2. Commit and push:

        ```sh
        git add .
        git commit -m "chore: changeset"
        git push
        ```

3. The Changesets GitHub Action will automatically create a Pull Request for the release.

4. Review and merge the release Pull Request. Ensure youâ€™re ready to publish the changes before merging.

5. The package will be published to NPM automatically using the `NPM_TOKEN` stored in your GitHub secrets.

</Steps>
