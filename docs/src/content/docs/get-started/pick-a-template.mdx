title: Pick a template

There are currently 2 available templates (more to come):

- [Manual (AIK)](/templates/manual-kit/): it uses a manual release script and ships with [Astro Integration Kit](https://astro-integration-kit.netlify.app/)
- [GitHub (AIK)](/templates/github-kit/): it uses a GitHub Action to automatically release and ship with [Astro Integration Kit](https://astro-integration-kit.netlify.app/)

All templates are structured as a monorepo with the package and a playground to easily test manually features.
